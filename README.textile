h1. Xtext 2 experiment

Here you will find some experiments with Xtext 2.1 and Xbase.

You will find the following projects:

h2. hellojvmtypes

Some experiments accessing JVM Types from an Xtext DSL (without using Xbase).  Blogged here: "Using JVM Types in Xtext 2.1 and the ImportManager":http://www.rcp-vision.com/?p=1573 .

h2. helloxbase

Some experiments using Xbase expressions in an Xtext DSL, while keeping control on the generation (and reusing XbaseCompiler for generating Java code corresponding to Xbase expressions).  Blogged here: "Xtext 2.1: using Xbase expressions":http://www.rcp-vision.com/?p=1640 .

h2. helloxvars

Some experiments using Xbase variable declarations in an Xtext DSL, while keeping control on the generation (and reusing XbaseCompiler for generating Java code corresponding to Xbase variable declarations and initialization expressions).  Blogged here: "Xtext 2.1: using Xbase variables":http://www.rcp-vision.com/?p=1796 .
